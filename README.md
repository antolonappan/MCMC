Parameter estimation of cosmological model


This is a C++ Code written for fitting data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and Bayesian statistics.In particular this is a multi threaded program, here two thread will generate two parameter chains concurrently and Gelman-Rubin diagnostics will be done in the third thread.

You can compile the code using command:g++ -pthread -std=c++11 code_file

Use x.txt, y.txt, dy.txt with parabola.cpp.Data for parabola is generated by setting a=1,b=0 and c=0. Error dy is taken as the 10% of y and cascaded with gaussian noise

dataanalysis1.py & dataanalysis2.py is for data generated by project.cpp.Data for this code can be Hubble data(see page.62 of MSC dissertation).

If you want to analysis this code,frist play around with parabola.cpp, then switch to project.cpp
